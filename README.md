## Study Group Curriculum - Winter 2017

This is the home of the Clojure Berlin study group curriculum Winter 2016.

We still need some help to fill the empty spots!

### How can I help?

* Head to the [Issues](/../../issues)
* There is an open issue for each *week* of the study group that still needs curriculum work. 
* Pick an issue that interests you, and let people know you are working on it.
* Read the `Goal` and `Todo` section carefully. 
* Follow the steps under `Todo`. 
* Open a PR to add your work to this repo.
