## Study Group Curriculum - Winter 2016

This is the home of the Clojure Berlin study group curriculum Winter 2016.

We still need some help to fill the empty spots!

### How can I help?

* Head to the [Issues](/../../issues)
* Pick a week that no-one has assigned or commented
* Read the description of the topic
* Let people know you are working on the issue by commenting on it
* Create an example quil sketch for the description
* Think of bonus exercises to extend the sketch
* Open a PR to add your sketch to this repo
