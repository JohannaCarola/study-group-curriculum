## Week 1

In week 1 we'll take a look at the basics: changing colors and drawing shapes.

You'll navigate the [Quil documentation](http://quil.info/api) to find what you're looking for and create a painting of your own.

Look for abstract paintings that you can redraw or take a look at the example sketch!
