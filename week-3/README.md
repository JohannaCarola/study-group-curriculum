## Week 3

### User Interaction


Drawing things is fun. Interactive drawing is even more fun.

Quil provides some functions that let you read mouse clicks or keys pressed.
You can use those values directly in your code and can have them influence position or color of your sketch.

You can read about those functions in the [Quil api section for input](http://quil.info/api/input).
You can also take a look at the example project.
